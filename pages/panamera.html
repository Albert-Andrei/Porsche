            <p>
                The Porsche Panamera is a mid/full-sized luxury vehicle (E-segment in Europe) manufactured by the German automobile manufacturer Porsche.[1][2][3] It is front-engined and has a rear-wheel-drive layout, with all-wheel drive versions also available.

                The production version of the Porsche Panamera was unveiled at the 13th Auto Shanghai International Automobile Show in Shanghai, China, in April 2009.[4] In 2011, hybrid and diesel versions were launched. In April 2013, a facelift to the Panamera was announced, making its debut again at the Shanghai Auto Show.[5] A plug-in hybrid version, the Panamera S E-Hybrid, was released in the U.S. market in November 2013.[6] The Panamera range received a re-design in 2016.
                <br/>
                The Panamera's name is derived, like the Porsche Carrera lineage, from the Carrera Panamericana race. The Panamera is generally considered to be the long-awaited fruit of Porsche's 989 concept vehicle from the late 1980s.[citation needed]

Like the Porsche Cayenne SUV (which has become the marque's best-selling vehicle), the Panamera upset many Porsche purists, since it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond that of hardcore fans. The Panamera ran contrary to the company's signature offerings, particularly its light two-door rear-engine sports cars like the 911. The Panamera on the other hand is considered a full-size luxury car, weighing nearly 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg), with four doors, and its engine mounted in the front. The Panamera's appearance with its long hood and rear hatch bears resemblance to a stretched 911.[7] The 911 has a sparse interior, as it was focused on raw performance, while the Panamera has a sumptuous interior loaded with modern technological amenities and expensive leather upholstery.[8][9]
